## RustSmith: A randomized program generator for Rust

RustSmith is a fuzzer built for the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language with
the purpose of fuzzing the Rust compiler (rustc) and find compiler crashes and mis-compilations
within the compiler. This repo contains the source code of the generator along with information on
how to install and use it.

## Getting Started

To get started with RustSmith, there are a couple of options as shown below:

### Recommended Method

To download and install RustSmith, the recommended method is to simply download the "RustSmith
Executable" from the latest release from the "Releases" panel on the right.

RustSmith can then be invoked as below:

```shell
    ./rustsmith --help
```

### Docker

Docker can also be used in the following way using the latest docker image:

```shell
docker run --rm ghcr.io/rustsmith/rustsmith --help
```

### Running RustSmith using the JAR File

Alternatively, the JAR file in the releases can be downloaded and used instead. RustSmith would then
be invoked as:

```shell
    java -jar RustSmith-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar
```

## Building from Source

To build RustSmith from source, an installation of Java 15 is required. More information for
installing OpenJDK 15 can be found on the [OpenJDK Website](https://openjdk.java.net).

Building and executing RustSmith can then be done as follows:

```shell
    git clone git@github.com:rustsmith/rustsmith.git
    cd rustsmith
    ./gradlew build
```

This will create both the standalone executable under `./run/rustsmith` and the packaged JAR file
under `./build/libs/RustSmith-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar` which can then be executed as described above.

## Usage

```shell
Usage: rustsmith [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -n, -count INT    No. of files to generate
  -p, -print        Print out program only
  -f, -fail-fast    Use fail fast approach
  -s, -seed INT     Optional Seed
  --directory TEXT  Directory to save files
  -h, --help        Show this message and exit
```
